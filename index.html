<!--Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function 
    called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
    We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. 
    Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output 
    before moving to the next step!  

    Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. 
    The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
    and then return a string that declares the winner or tie of the round 
    like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

    Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive 
    (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
